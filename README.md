# Wage-classifier
Binary classifier in Tensorflow to predict if the wage is more or less then 50k given the "census income" database

## Requirements
To run this program the Numpy and Tensorflow library are required. 
To install Numpy, you can download it from the official website here:
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

or you can use 

```
pip install numpy
```

To install Tensorflow, follow the instruction in the official website:
* [Tensorflow installing](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

## Dataset choice
The data set I choose to show this simple multiclass classifier is a "census income" database. The database is open to the public, and it has been provided by the following source:

Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

The database can be found online here:
* [Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)

## Modification ##
Feel free to modify the structure and the main parameters of this linear classifier. If you want to use another database and you should have the file in the same folder for this to work. Also remember to change the dimension of the matrices consequently.
